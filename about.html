        <p>Hello. My name is Oliver Mio Leander Bing-Hansen. Im 16 years old and currently a first year IT and
            Mediaproduction(IM) student at Kuben highschool in Norway. here we are learning programing and coding as
            well as design and picture/video. I've learnd to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm also familiar with
            adobe programs such as photoshop, illustrator, indesign as well as premiere pro. I have so far enjoyed
            coding and programing and i think i wanna become an IT developer. <br>
            Me going to this school was kind of random. I didn't know what i wanted to do when i got older and feelt
            lost when we were picking schools. Iv'e always had a "logical" way of thinking and thought coding was
            something i could enjoy learning combined with the fact that it was an area with a lot of oprotunities for
            workers. <br> I spend my free time with family, friends or my girlfriend. I've been working out a couple
            days a week for the last nine months now and im planing on staying in that routine. <br>I've also been
            teaching myself how to solve the Rubik's cube the last year. First day learning how to solve it and the
            reast of the year on how to solve it fast! For those wondering im currently averaging at about 12.5 seconds.
